                            I purchased a bottle of your marinade from a Super Walmart in Citrus Heights, CA. My wife and a few of her friends were going to see Reba out of town, so I wanted to grill something while she was gone and spoil my 90 year old mother in law. On Saturday, I marinated some skinless, boneless chicken breast for about four hours and cooked them up. The flavor from your marinade was excellent and some, but not too much, of the spicy came through. It was very tasty and I got good reviews from my m-i-l and my eldest son.
                            Then on Sunday I marinated about a pound and a half of tri-tip steak for 5-6 hours. I couldn't believe the taste when I took my first bite. It was fantastic. The marinade soaked all the way through the steaks. These weren't very thick pieces (3/4" to 1"), so I can imagine how good it's going to taste on a thicker cut.
                            Thanks for putting out a great product. I plan on being a customer for a long time.,<br />

                            I bought some of your sauce in California recently and I absolutely LOVE it! I haven't cooked meat without it since! I'll definitely be needing more, but just wanted to find out the price for the gallon of original and 12 oz spicy for now (haven't tried this one yet). May be ordering some for Christmas gifts, so trying to get an idea of prices for each. The shipping will be to Virginia, if that helps. Any info is greatly appreciated. This is one of the best marinades I've EVER come across!!! Keep up the good work! You make our lame cows taste like real meat!!,<br />

                            I live in Winnemucca,NV. I was in Albertson's when they were giving samples of your sauces. Gotta LOVE the hot and spicy. I have used it in every thing from bbq to gravies. I think it has become a staple. keep up the good work.,<br />

                            I absolutely LOVE your Dakota Buckaroo Marinating Sauce. I know I am not asking much (ha), but I am having a BBQ this weekend and was disappointment and in a panic when Albertsons told me that I would not be able to purchase your sauce from them.,<br />

                            I was in Boise and brought your original marinade home and everyone loved it. Need to get it on the shelves of super markets on the east coast.,<br />

                            I really enjoyed visiting with you while you were demonstrating your product at Albertson's in Richland Washington. Yes my guests were impressed even when using premade hamburgers. Have you made arrangements to have Dakota Buckaroo available in our area on a regular basis? Many of our friends want to be able to get some.,<br />
